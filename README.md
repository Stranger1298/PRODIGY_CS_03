# ProdigyTech Password Complexity Checker

## Overview

Welcome to the ProdigyTech Password Complexity Checker! This Python project is designed to address a fundamental aspect of application security: password strength assessment. The program evaluates the complexity of passwords provided by users, taking into account various factors such as uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. Based on this analysis, it categorizes passwords as strong, weak, or medium in terms of their security.

## Features

- **Password Identification:** The program identifies and analyzes passwords provided by users.
- **Strength Assessment:** Utilizing a set of criteria including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters, the program evaluates the strength of passwords.
- **Categorization:** Passwords are categorized as strong, weak, or medium based on their complexity.
- **Ease of Use:** The project is implemented in Python, ensuring ease of understanding and modification for developers.

## Components

The ProdigyTech Password Complexity Checker comprises two major components:

1. **Password Identification:** This component is responsible for detecting and capturing passwords provided by users.

2. **Strength Assessment:** The strength assessment component evaluates the complexity of passwords based on the presence of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.

## Usage

To use the ProdigyTech Password Complexity Checker, follow these steps:

1. **Run the Program:** Execute the Python script containing the program.

2. **Input Password:** Input the password you wish to evaluate when prompted.

3. **View Result:** The program will output the strength of the password, indicating whether it is strong, weak, or medium in terms of security.

## How It Works

The Password Complexity Checker employs a set of rules to evaluate the complexity of passwords. These rules include:

- Presence of uppercase letters
- Presence of lowercase letters
- Presence of digits
- Presence of special characters

Based on the combination of these factors, the program categorizes passwords into three main categories:

- **Strong:** Passwords with a diverse combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.
- **Weak:** Passwords lacking one or more essential components such as uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, or special characters.
- **Medium:** Passwords that meet some, but not all, criteria for strong passwords.
